# Up-Wing Priorities



Around 2010 the world will be at a
new orbit in history. We will
translive all over this planet and
the solar sphere — at home everywhere.
We will be hyperfluid: skim on
land — swim in the deep oceans — flash
across the sky.

Family will have given way to Universal life. People will linkup/linkout free
of kinship and possessiveness.

We will stream ahead propelled by a
cornucopia of abundance.

Life expectancy will be indefinite.
Disease and disability will nonexist.
Death will be rare and accidental — but
not permanent. We will continuously
jettison our obsolescence and grow
younger.

At 2000 plus ten all this will be the
norm — hardly considered marvelous.

But why wait for 2010? A new ideological thrust — a new set of priorities can
help accelerate our upflow.

All the old guidelines are now off target. Capitalism and socialism for example are burned out industrial-age constructs. They have helped propel us to
this time zone. But they have no scenarios for higher orbits. At best they want to
realign existing social systems.

The Right/Left has no program to
screen out aging and death. No grand
designs for our new civilizations across
the solar system. Right/Left planners
are still committed to the "industrialization of space" — orbital communities
with three-story houses — eight-to-five
jobs — schools — farms — Italian restaurants! Is this why we want to trailblaze
across the universe?

Throughout the 20th century the
world has veered Left. In the coming
years we will wing beyond Right and
Left. We will move Up.

Up is a triumphant new trajectory — a
coalescence of all the Big Bang breakthroughs of our times.

The following Up-Wing priorities are
interdependent— to advance rapidly in
any one area we must leap ahead in all
areas.

These priorities are accelerators — targeted to speed up our forward thrust to
the first or second decade of the next
century. By 2010 we will have splashed
through so many Time shifts that we will
need entirely new accelerators.

## Physical Immortality
The most basic
and urgent problem facing us is death.
All other human constraints are derivative. Death casts a pall over all of life. So
long as we are terminal we cannot enhance the basic quality of life. So long as
there is death no one is free.

Accelerators: Slow down aging
through genetic/cellular intervention.
Telemonitor every person for continuous protection from internal and external hazards. Reformat our terminal
bodies into versatile telebodies with easy
plug in replacement parts. Facilitate
freefly to reduce gravitational wear and



tear and rapidly break away from natural disasters. Provide universal cryonic
suspension in case of unavoidable death.
Spread a Psychology of Immortality — the will to live forever.

## Space Colonization
We must urgently accelerate colonization and exploration of the solar system and the universe
beyond. Why is this a top priority? Because such a trajectory opens up a Pandora's Box of infinite space — infinite
energy — infinite raw materials — infinite
growth. Quickens transition beyond industriaHsm. Accelerates evolution from
Earth-programmed animal/humans to
post humans. Multiplies chances for interconnect with other intelligences which
could instantly lightspeed us ahead a
mini on years.

During these trans-century decades
orbital societies offer excellent opportunities for clean rapid break from Earth
conditions which for millenniums have
perpetuated human suffering. Under no
circumstances should we replicate
Earth-like societies: no exclusive procreation or parenting — no families schools
hospitals or prisons — no money economies or subsistence work — no slaughter
of animals for food — no leadership
governments— no nations — no cemeteries. Orbital civilizations should start off
with 21st-century telespheres.

## Telespheres
Let us speedup the orbit
shift from industrialism to the new age.
The world of telespheres is flowing from
the confluence of breakthroughs in
many areas: limitless energy — interactive telecommunication — ultra intelligent machines — biological and cultural
revolutions — space colonization. These
and other forces are recontexting life in
fundamentally new ways. We are creating electronic environments that integrate all peoples and services. No one
need remain waterholed near stationary
centralized sources of learning livelihood or decision making. You connect
from wherever you are. For example the
track beyond school is teleducation
which facilitates transmission of continuous updated info to anyone anywhere
anytime. Beyond hospital — preventive
telemedicine. Beyond bureaucracy — telemanagement and teleconference. Beyond vindictive judicial systems — preventive crime telemonitor. Beyond profit retailing — direct teleshopping from
production decenters. Beyond leadership government — teledemocracy via
universal referendums ....

## Telebrain
How do we fastforward
the human brain? Continued mapping
of more and more of the brain. Implanted slow-release drugs to self-regulate
moods and biochemical shifts. Genetic
engineering to regenerate aging brain
cells — upgrade intelligence — deactivate
vestigial parts of brain.

Plug in/plug off super microchip implants to amplify brain versatility and
power. For example: millisec computations in the head with visual displays —
instant access to info — hi-speed playback — simultaneous info retrieval/transmission. Implanted transceiver for direct brain to brain interface. Implanted
sensors for continuous monitoring of all
body functions and self-regulation of
biorhythms and mood swings. By 2010
the human brain should emerge as a super telebrain — a powerful autonomous
transceiver free of the animal body —
able to connect with new replaceable
bodies.

##Universal Life
We need to hasten the
transition to universal telegenesis universal parenting universal life. Mating is
no longer necessary to perpetuate the
species. We can now reproduce through
insemination — inovulation — telegenesis — in vitro births — in vitro cloning. As
mating loses biological function family — marriage — coupling phase out. Humanity is decoupling. In our rapidly
converging worlds we need to grow fluid
and universal— able to connect with
more and more people without getting
blackholed in exclusive commitments.

Accelerators: Fertilize only those
screened sex cells most likely to spawn
healthy wholesome new lives. (Later we
will mix most desirable elements of
many people's cells.) Identities of those
whose sex cells are selected for reproduction are never disclosed. Therefore the
newborn belong to no specific parents.
They lift off in mobilias — with many
trans parents. Shared parenthood eases
burdens on parents and reduces the
child's early programming to lifelong
painful traumas of imprinting and possessiveness.

As coupling phases out people flow
within a global network of linkups. By
2010 exclusivity will have phased out.
Whose child are you? Whose parents?
Whose sister or brother? Who are you
involved with? All these will be flashbacks from our tribal past. People will
connect openly freely universally.

## Teleconomics
To stream full blast to
21st-century teleconomics we must
speedup development of solar energy — nuclear fusion — hydrogen fuel.
Energy is the central accelerator. Abundant energy means overflow food and
limitless raw materials. The new wealth
— particularly solar energy — is nonmonopolizable and will reinforce global decentralization of wealth — information
— power. The new abundance also accelerates development of intelligent technology which will cancel out subsistence
work and labor force. Work will be
transformed into a voluntary creative
process. By 2010 the glut of energy will
hasten phase out of money which in turn
will help phase out profit and competition — imbalances in wealth — conflicts
of interest — cycles of inflation/recession — exploitation. How absurd all this
emphasis on finite resources and sacrifice at the very moment in evolution
when we are opening up the infinite resources of the universe. We have superabundant resources to last us a million
years — a billion years. Enough to last
for as long as there is a Universe.

> "We want to
spread a new
awareness that
from here on we
ore resigned to
nothing — consider
no human problems irreversible — no goals
unattainable."  

## Teledemocracy
All forms of leadership are intrinsically authoritarian — the
differences are in degrees. Voting for
leaders and representatives (who then
make unilateral decisions for the people)
is not democracy. Let us stop deluding
ourselves. In our times democracy
means direct participation in all decision
making. This means voting not for
leaders — but voting directly on issues.

Accelerators: Every week every
month — or as often as necessary — people deploy their transceivers to vote
directly on issues . All sides of every issue
are regularly telecast. Computer flashforwards of probable consequences of
each scenario are simultaneously aired.
(Because there are no struggles for leadership issues are depoliticized. The focus
is on merits of each plan.) Temporary
committees (picked at random every
month) supervise the referendums and
the implementation of decisions. In the
age of two-way interactive telespheres
leaders and representatives are as
superfluous as scribes. By the first decade of the new century government will
exist mainly in name as power will shift
to the people via direct consensing.

## Telecommunities
Industrial age cities
have a great future — as museums. We
should close them down and clear out.
What will replace cities? We have some
early forerunners of 21st century
telecommunities: mobile communities —
airparks — global festivals — global festivals — global video events — space colonies.

A telecommunity can be instant — activated in days dismanded in hours.
These new communities accomodate the
increasing mobility of people — they are
in effect liftoff /landing platforms. They
are also fluid and modular — no stones
bricks or concrete — nothing that will
stay long enough to atrophy into
tenements and ghettoes. Abundant solar
energy means that these linkup spheres
can be set up anywhere. Deploy only
automated vehicles and any modules
that fly. Streets are obsolete. The new
communities are completely telesphered : teleducation — telemedicine —
teleshopping etc. The size is nonissue
— they continuously expand contract
transform as people flow in and out.
Telecommunities coalesce the new
variables and can act as momentum
swings to 21st-century life.

## Globalism
In the age of global telecommunication — supersonics and
world travel — global economy — nations exist mostly in name. In our times
nationalism is a sure sign of backwardness. Nations are like peeing territories
charted by dogs. Such territoriality is antifuture — **you should be able to pee anywhere in the world.**

Accelerators: More and more global
infrastructures to accommodate global
issues. Global referendums — global telecom networks and publications — global
exchange programs — common markets
and regional blocs — universal language
(Unilang) — anything that will bring us
together.

How can you the individual reinforce
this process? For one thing publicly
disavow nationality. What is your nationality? I am global. But where are you
from? I am from planet Earth. Such a
stand can help spread the new consciousness. Live global: Each time you travel
you make the world a Uttle more intimate. The earlier children translive
around the world the better the chances
they will emerge as world people and
globalize the rest. There are no more
tourists or foreigners no internal affairs
or national honor. This whole planet
now belongs to all of us.

## 21st Century Values
Traditional values have issued from eons of scarcity
— hardship — brief lifespans — insularity. Late 20th-century breakthroughs are
formatting new environments which
spawn new values and ideals. A 21stcentury consciousness is surfacing increasingly free of Puritan guilt —
shame — cynicism — self-denial .

What does the oldworld psychology
of sacrifice mean in the new age of abundance? Entire generations are coming on
line who have never known poverty and
hardship — for whom abundance and
comfort are the norm. The new consciousness views hardship as stunting — wealth as liberating.

What does age-old orientation to suffering mean at a time when medical
breakthroughs are screening out physical and mental pain?

What does the work ethic mean in the
age of intelligent technology which is
taking over more and more of our work?
The work ethic now slows down growth.
The new Leisure ethic accelerates innovation and progress.


> "How absurd all
this emphasis on
finite resources
and sacrifice at the
very nnoment
when we are
opening up the infinite resources of
the universe."





 What does competitiveness mean in
an age of plenty? Why do we need to
know who is best at anything? Why contests? Why winners and losers? Why the
Nobel prize the Pulitzer prize the
Academy Awards? Systems that pit people against one another are oldworld and
manipulative and must be boycotted.
Competition saps everyone's energy. To
hyperspeed ahead we need complementation of everyone's creativity.

What do religions and spiritualisms
wliich demand child-like submission to
deities and "higher authorities" mean at
a time when vigorous new generations
growing up in permissive open environments accept no authorities as final
t)r absolute? At a time when our cosmic
leaps are daily proving that there are no
permanent constraints — that we are free
agents in the Universe?

The greatest breakthrough of our age
is unfolding in our self image. A new
brand of revolutionary is fast emerging
— fired up by entirely new dreams. UpWingers are not content with civil rights
— equal rights — human rights. These
freedoms are no longer enough.

We now want to design all areas of
our evolution. We want biological freedoms. We want the freedom to spread
out across the Universe. We want each
one of us to be alive a hundred years
from now — a thousand years — a
million — forever.

We want to spread a daring new optimism crystallizing from the obvious fact
that for the first time in all the eons of life
we are no longer blackholed within this
microplanet — no longer trapped within
fragile terminal bodies — that we are
emerging as a triumphant new
species — extraterrestrial and immortal.

We want to spread a new optimism
and self-confidence stemming from the
glaring fact that we who launch probes
into interstellar reaches — we who flash
signals to other beings across the Milky
Way^5-we who decode light streaming in
from the outbanks of the Universe over
ten billion light-years away — can surely
now mobilize our genius to accomphsh
anything.

We want to spread a new awareness
that from here on we are resigned to
nothing — consider no human problems
irreversible — no goals unattainable.

We want to spread the awareness that
we are at lift off to a beautiful new age.
There is a new Hope in the world.
