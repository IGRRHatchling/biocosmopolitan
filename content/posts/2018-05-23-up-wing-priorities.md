> FM. Esfandiary is a telecommuni- 
cator — writer — long-range plan- 
ner — university lecturer. He has 
taught Up- Wing philosophy since the 
mid-1960s— first at the New School 
for Social Research (New York) and 
currently at UCLA (Extension). His 
most recent books are Optimism 
One — Up- Wingers — Telespheres. 

> Esfandiary says: "lam universal. I 
translive all over the planet. Learn via 
telecom. Have many professions. 
Am involved with many people. Con- 
sider all children as mine also. Neither 
right nor left — / am Up. I have no 
age. Am born and reborn everyday. I 
intend to live forever. Barring an ac- 
cident I probably will. I also want to 
help others live on indefinitely. My 
philosophy: optimism^abun- 
dance — universalism — immor- 
tality." 



# Up-Wing Priorities 



Around 2010 the world will be at a 
new orbit in history. We will 
translive all over this planet and 
the solar sphere — at home everywhere. 
We will be hyperfluid: skim on 
land — swim in the deep oceans — flash 
across the sky. 

Family will have given way to Univer- 
sal life. People will linkup/linkout free 
of kinship and possessiveness. 

We will stream ahead propelled by a 
cornucopia of abundance. 

Life expectancy will be indefinite. 
Disease and disability will nonexist. 
Death will be rare and accidental — but 
not permanent. We will continuously 
jettison our obsolescence and grow 
younger. 

At 2000 plus ten all this will be the 
norm — hardly considered marvelous. 

But why wait for 2010? A new ideo- 
logical thrust — a new set of priorities can 
help accelerate our upflow. 

All the old guidelines are now off tar- 
get. Capitalism and socialism for exam- 
ple are burned out industrial-age con- 
structs. They have helped propel us to 
this time zone. But they have no scenar- 
ios for higher orbits. At best they want to 
realign existing social systems. 

The Right/Left has no program to 
screen out aging and death. No grand 
designs for our new civilizations across 
the solar system. Right/Left planners 
are still committed to the "industrializa- 
tion of space" — orbital communities 
with three-story houses — eight-to-five 
jobs — schools — farms — Italian restau- 
rants! Is this why we want to trailblaze 
across the universe? 

Throughout the 20th century the 
world has veered Left. In the coming 
years we will wing beyond Right and 
Left. We will move Up. 

Up is a triumphant new trajectory — a 
coalescence of all the Big Bang break- 
throughs of our times. 

The following Up-Wing priorities are 
interdependent— to advance rapidly in 
any one area we must leap ahead in all 
areas. 

These priorities are accelerators — tar- 
geted to speed up our forward thrust to 
the first or second decade of the next 
century. By 2010 we will have splashed 
through so many Time shifts that we will 
need entirely new accelerators. 

## Physical Immortality
The most basic 
and urgent problem facing us is death. 
All other human constraints are deriva- 
tive. Death casts a pall over all of life. So 
long as we are terminal we cannot en- 
hance the basic quality of life. So long as 
there is death no one is free. 

Accelerators: Slow down aging 
through genetic/cellular intervention. 
Telemonitor every person for continu- 
ous protection from internal and exter- 
nal hazards. Reformat our terminal 
bodies into versatile telebodies with easy 
plug in replacement parts. Facilitate 
freefly to reduce gravitational wear and 



tear and rapidly break away from natur- 
al disasters. Provide universal cryonic 
suspension in case of unavoidable death. 
Spread a Psychology of Immortali- 
ty — the will to live forever. 

## Space Colonization
We must urgent- 
ly accelerate colonization and explora- 
tion of the solar system and the universe 
beyond. Why is this a top priority? Be- 
cause such a trajectory opens up a Pan- 
dora's Box of infinite space — infinite 
energy — infinite raw materials — infinite 
growth. Quickens transition beyond in- 
dustriaHsm. Accelerates evolution from 
Earth-programmed animal/humans to 
post humans. Multiplies chances for in- 
terconnect with other intelligences which 
could instantly lightspeed us ahead a 
mini on years. 

During these trans-century decades 
orbital societies offer excellent oppor- 
tunities for clean rapid break from Earth 
conditions which for millenniums have 
perpetuated human suffering. Under no 
circumstances should we replicate 
Earth-like societies: no exclusive procre- 
ation or parenting — no families schools 
hospitals or prisons — no money econo- 
mies or subsistence work — no slaughter 
of animals for food — no leadership 
governments— no nations — no cemeter- 
ies. Orbital civilizations should start off 
with 21st-century telespheres. 

## Telespheres
Let us speedup the orbit 
shift from industrialism to the new age. 
The world of telespheres is flowing from 
the confluence of breakthroughs in 
many areas: limitless energy — interac- 
tive telecommunication — ultra intelli- 
gent machines — biological and cultural 
revolutions — space colonization. These 
and other forces are recontexting life in 
fundamentally new ways. We are creat- 
ing electronic environments that inte- 
grate all peoples and services. No one 
need remain waterholed near stationary 
centralized sources of learning liveli- 
hood or decision making. You connect 
from wherever you are. For example the 
track beyond school is teleducation 
which facilitates transmission of contin- 
uous updated info to anyone anywhere 
anytime. Beyond hospital — preventive 
telemedicine. Beyond bureaucracy — tel- 
emanagement and teleconference. Be- 
yond vindictive judicial systems — pre- 
ventive crime telemonitor. Beyond prof- 
it retailing — direct teleshopping from 
production decenters. Beyond leader- 
ship government — teledemocracy via 
universal referendums .... 

## Telebrain
How do we fastforward 
the human brain? Continued mapping 
of more and more of the brain. Implant- 
ed slow-release drugs to self-regulate 
moods and biochemical shifts. Genetic 
engineering to regenerate aging brain 
cells — upgrade intelligence — deactivate 
vestigial parts of brain. 

Plug in/plug off super microchip im- 
plants to amplify brain versatility and 
power. For example: millisec computa- 
tions in the head with visual displays — 
instant access to info — hi-speed play- 
back — simultaneous info retrieval/trans- 
mission. Implanted transceiver for di- 
rect brain to brain interface. Implanted 
sensors for continuous monitoring of all 
body functions and self-regulation of 
biorhythms and mood swings. By 2010 
the human brain should emerge as a su- 
per telebrain — a powerful autonomous 
transceiver free of the animal body — 
able to connect with new replaceable 
bodies. 

##Universal Life
We need to hasten the 
transition to universal telegenesis uni- 
versal parenting universal life. Mating is 
no longer necessary to perpetuate the 
species. We can now reproduce through 
insemination — inovulation — telegene- 
sis — in vitro births — in vitro cloning. As 
mating loses biological function fami- 
ly — marriage — coupling phase out. Hu- 
manity is decoupling. In our rapidly 
converging worlds we need to grow fluid 
and universal— able to connect with 
more and more people without getting 
blackholed in exclusive commitments. 

Accelerators: Fertilize only those 
screened sex cells most likely to spawn 
healthy wholesome new lives. (Later we 
will mix most desirable elements of 
many people's cells.) Identities of those 
whose sex cells are selected for reproduc- 
tion are never disclosed. Therefore the 
newborn belong to no specific parents. 
They lift off in mobilias — with many 
trans parents. Shared parenthood eases 
burdens on parents and reduces the 
child's early programming to lifelong 
painful traumas of imprinting and pos- 
sessiveness. 

As coupling phases out people flow 
within a global network of linkups. By 
2010 exclusivity will have phased out. 
Whose child are you? Whose parents? 
Whose sister or brother? Who are you 
involved with? All these will be flash- 
backs from our tribal past. People will 
connect openly freely universally. 

## Teleconomics 
To stream full blast to 
21st-century teleconomics we must 
speedup development of solar ener- 
gy — nuclear fusion — hydrogen fuel. 
Energy is the central accelerator. Abun- 
dant energy means overflow food and 
limitless raw materials. The new wealth 
— particularly solar energy — is nonmo- 
nopolizable and will reinforce global de- 
centralization of wealth — information 
— power. The new abundance also accel- 
erates development of intelligent tech- 
nology which will cancel out subsistence 
work and labor force. Work will be 
transformed into a voluntary creative 
process. By 2010 the glut of energy will 
hasten phase out of money which in turn 
will help phase out profit and competi- 
tion — imbalances in wealth — conflicts 
of interest — cycles of inflation/reces- 
sion — exploitation. How absurd all this 
emphasis on finite resources and sac- 
rifice at the very moment in evolution 
when we are opening up the infinite re- 
sources of the universe. We have super- 
abundant resources to last us a million 
years — a billion years. Enough to last 
for as long as there is a Universe.

> "We want to 
spread a new 
awareness that 
from here on we 
ore resigned to 
nothing — consider 
no human prob- 
lems irrevers- 
ible — no goals 
unattainable."  

## Teledemocracy 
All forms of leader- 
ship are intrinsically authoritarian — the 
differences are in degrees. Voting for 
leaders and representatives (who then 
make unilateral decisions for the people) 
is not democracy. Let us stop deluding 
ourselves. In our times democracy 
means direct participation in all decision 
making. This means voting not for 
leaders — but voting directly on issues. 

Accelerators: Every week every 
month — or as often as necessary — peo- 
ple deploy their transceivers to vote 
directly on issues . All sides of every issue 
are regularly telecast. Computer flash- 
forwards of probable consequences of 
each scenario are simultaneously aired. 
(Because there are no struggles for lead- 
ership issues are depoliticized. The focus 
is on merits of each plan.) Temporary 
committees (picked at random every 
month) supervise the referendums and 
the implementation of decisions. In the 
age of two-way interactive telespheres 
leaders and representatives are as 
superfluous as scribes. By the first dec- 
ade of the new century government will 
exist mainly in name as power will shift 
to the people via direct consensing. 

## Telecommunities
Industrial age cities 
have a great future — as museums. We 
should close them down and clear out. 
What will replace cities? We have some 
early forerunners of 21st century 
telecommunities: mobile communities — 
airparks — global festivals — global festi- 
vals — global video events — space colo- 
nies. 

A telecommunity can be instant — ac- 
tivated in days dismanded in hours. 
These new communities accomodate the 
increasing mobility of people — they are 
in effect liftoff /landing platforms. They 
are also fluid and modular — no stones 
bricks or concrete — nothing that will 
stay long enough to atrophy into 
tenements and ghettoes. Abundant solar 
energy means that these linkup spheres 
can be set up anywhere. Deploy only 
automated vehicles and any modules 
that fly. Streets are obsolete. The new 
communities are completely tele- 
sphered : teleducation — telemedicine — 
teleshopping etc. The size is nonissue 
— they continuously expand contract 
transform as people flow in and out. 
Telecommunities coalesce the new 
variables and can act as momentum 
swings to 21st-century life. 

## Globalism
In the age of global tele- 
communication — supersonics and 
world travel — global economy — na- 
tions exist mostly in name. In our times 
nationalism is a sure sign of backward- 
ness. Nations are like peeing territories 
charted by dogs. Such territoriality is an- 
tifuture — **you should be able to pee any- 
where in the world.** 

Accelerators: More and more global 
infrastructures to accommodate global 
issues. Global referendums — global tele- 
com networks and publications — global 
exchange programs — common markets 
and regional blocs — universal language 
(Unilang) — anything that will bring us 
together. 

How can you the individual reinforce 
this process? For one thing publicly 
disavow nationality. What is your na- 
tionality? I am global. But where are you 
from? I am from planet Earth. Such a 
stand can help spread the new conscious- 
ness. Live global: Each time you travel 
you make the world a Uttle more in- 
timate. The earlier children translive 
around the world the better the chances 
they will emerge as world people and 
globalize the rest. There are no more 
tourists or foreigners no internal affairs 
or national honor. This whole planet 
now belongs to all of us. 

## 21st Century Values 
Traditional val- 
ues have issued from eons of scarcity 
— hardship — brief lifespans — insulari- 
ty. Late 20th-century breakthroughs are 
formatting new environments which 
spawn new values and ideals. A 21st- 
century consciousness is surfacing in- 
creasingly free of Puritan guilt — 
shame — cynicism — self-denial . 

What does the oldworld psychology 
of sacrifice mean in the new age of abun- 
dance? Entire generations are coming on 
line who have never known poverty and 
hardship — for whom abundance and 
comfort are the norm. The new con- 
sciousness views hardship as stunt- 
ing — wealth as liberating. 

What does age-old orientation to suf- 
fering mean at a time when medical 
breakthroughs are screening out physi- 
cal and mental pain? 

What does the work ethic mean in the 
age of intelligent technology which is 
taking over more and more of our work? 
The work ethic now slows down growth. 
The new Leisure ethic accelerates in- 
novation and progress.


> "How absurd all 
this emphasis on 
finite resources 
and sacrifice at the 
very nnoment 
when we are 
opening up the in- 
finite resources of 
the universe." 

 



 What does competitiveness mean in 
an age of plenty? Why do we need to 
know who is best at anything? Why con- 
tests? Why winners and losers? Why the 
Nobel prize the Pulitzer prize the 
Academy Awards? Systems that pit peo- 
ple against one another are oldworld and 
manipulative and must be boycotted. 
Competition saps everyone's energy. To 
hyperspeed ahead we need complemen- 
tation of everyone's creativity. 

What do religions and spiritualisms 
wliich demand child-like submission to 
deities and "higher authorities" mean at 
a time when vigorous new generations 
growing up in permissive open en- 
vironments accept no authorities as final 
t)r absolute? At a time when our cosmic 
leaps are daily proving that there are no 
permanent constraints — that we are free 
agents in the Universe? 

The greatest breakthrough of our age 
is unfolding in our self image. A new 
brand of revolutionary is fast emerging 
— fired up by entirely new dreams. Up- 
Wingers are not content with civil rights 
— equal rights — human rights. These 
freedoms are no longer enough. 

We now want to design all areas of 
our evolution. We want biological free- 
doms. We want the freedom to spread 
out across the Universe. We want each 
one of us to be alive a hundred years 
from now — a thousand years — a 
million — forever. 

We want to spread a daring new opti- 
mism crystallizing from the obvious fact 
that for the first time in all the eons of life 
we are no longer blackholed within this 
microplanet — no longer trapped within 
fragile terminal bodies — that we are 
emerging as a triumphant new 
species — extraterrestrial and immortal. 

We want to spread a new optimism 
and self-confidence stemming from the 
glaring fact that we who launch probes 
into interstellar reaches — we who flash 
signals to other beings across the Milky 
Way^5-we who decode light streaming in 
from the outbanks of the Universe over 
ten billion light-years away — can surely 
now mobilize our genius to accomphsh 
anything. 

We want to spread a new awareness 
that from here on we are resigned to 
nothing — consider no human problems 
irreversible — no goals unattainable. 

We want to spread the awareness that 
we are at lift off to a beautiful new age. 
There is a new Hope in the world.
