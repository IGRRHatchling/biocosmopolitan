## Denizens of the biocosm, we are on our way!

The biocosmopolitan review is a gradually agglomerating cultural platform dedicated to publishing cutting edge gesticulations of the imagination. We are multi-futurists, building many worlds through the advancement of culture technology and stimulated communication.

We are scientists, anarchists, and transhuman eco-terrorist labrats. We are cognitive security hacks. We would not describe ourselves as ethical. We are the biocosmopolitans, the free rovers of the living world.

## We want to publish your work.

Send us your essays, stories, and research notes. Send us your recorded works. Send us your spectacular images. We will put them in a fancy place, for public consumption, in good company among other biocosmic singularities.

Act now, and receive as our gift to you a very special one size fits all multi-pattern threaded organic polymer meatsack, inscribed in the modern fashion with the words and motto "Wild Space Whale Society."

BEHOLD THE LIVING WORLD!
