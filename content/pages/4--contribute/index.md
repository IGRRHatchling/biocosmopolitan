## BIOCOSMOPOLITAN

## IS THE CULTURAL AGGLOMERATOR

## YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

The BIOCOSMOPOLITAN is a way of coping with the dystopian cyberpunk condition of the world. We fight for the living, during a time of mass extinction and killer robots. We want a platform for many different futures: alternatives to the grim future presented by our technological and corporate overlords. 

## We want to publish your work.

Our email address is biocosm@protomail.com.

Send us your essays, stories, and research notes. Send us your recorded works. Send us your spectacular images. We will put them in a fancy place, for public consumption, in good company among other biocosmic singularities.

Since we've only just begun, send us anything. The biocosmic strategy is to stay as flexible as possible for as long as possible. Expand our horizions. 

We'd especially like to see your longer works, essays, columns, images and comics. We like audio. We like video. Whether we like YOUR audio and video can only be determined by you sending it to us.

Topics we'd like to see covered are as follows, in no particular order:

climate change

artificial intelligence

decentralization

anti-capitalist economics

anti-economics

Afro-Futurism

Indigenous Futurism

Escapology

Astrobiology

Solarpunk
