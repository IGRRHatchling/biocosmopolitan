<!-- What -->
## BIOCOSMOPOLITAN IS A WEBSITE

### The internet. You've heard of it.

Behold: BIOCOSMOPOLITAN! We are not a journal, a magazine, a broadsheet, or a tabloid. We are a website: a crossroads in cyberspace where signs point in every direction.

<!-- Where -->
## BIOCOSMOPOLITAN IS A SPACE PLATFORM

We are unapologetically opinionated. BIOCOSMOPOLITAN is an up-wing news and media platform.

We publish news, reviews, columns, and podcasts from a pan-human, egalitarian, interplanetary perspective. We support efforts to transcend death, gravity, entropy, and all other limitations. We oppose all systems of control and oppression.

See our [space platform](/biocosm) for details.

<!-- Who -->
## BIOCOSMOPOLITAN IS A COMMUNITY

The ad-supported news media doesn't want to envision a fully automated luxury future. We at BIOCOSMOPOLITAN are completely worker- and [reader-supported](/donate) and owe our allegiance only to Utopia.

We want your opinions, your research notes, your recorded works and spectacular images. [Send them to us](/submit), and we will put them in a fancy place, in for public consumption, in good company amongst other biocosmic singularities.  


<!-- When -->
## BIOCOSMOPOLITAN IS FOR THE FUTURE

As denizens of the earth, we cannot be neutral in dealing with the powers of nature and of humankind. The twenty-first century will see overwhelming change in climate, in automation, in biotech, in war and netwar and politics.

Someone must take a stand for the future, for the lives of our great-great-grandchildren.

We want every human generation to have a better life than their parents. To do this, we must also steward the biosphere and the technosphere. Humanity and our tools are intimately dependent on the living systems of sea and soil and slime that surround us. We need our home planet to be stable, to have a healthy climate and a thriving ecology, if we want to have any chance at expanding the biocosm to the stars.

We will settle for nothing less than Utopia, but we can't demand all changes to happen at once. We build, pragmatically, but with haste, toward the techniques and technologies that will sustain our world for seven generations.

We are biocosmists. At night we sleep, and in the days we build the futures of which we dream.



<!-- Why -->
## BIOCOSMOPOLITAN IS CRUCIAL

We are at the threshold of a new kind of humanity. We have true knowledge of the world and the power to change it. We can tap the power of the atom and see the edge of the universe.

And yet we squabble and fight over ancient, wrongheaded ideas. Religion, ideology, nationalism: all distractions from the true purpose of the biocosm. There is no forum for those of us who would discuss grand visions and band together to make them come true.

We offer this website as a crucial meeting place for the those of the up-wing persuasion. We don't have to agree on everything. There is no One True Faith of biocosmism. We come together to discuss, to strategize, to celebrate and to mourn, as we travel forward in time on this spinning blue rock.
