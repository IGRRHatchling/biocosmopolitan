## BIOCOSMOPOLITAN IS COMMUNITY SUPPORTED

We are 100% worker- and reader-supported. We will never run ads, sell your information, or steal the stereo out your car.

But we're not above taking your spare change. We do need money to keep the pixels on and the abuse flowing. Life in space ain't cheap, and we're still paying off the fines for the time we got busted pirating lo-fi chill hop tapes.

We're not a business (OR ANY KIND OF LEGAL ENTITY) so we can't give you tax write-offs or credit card authorization.

If you want to donate fiat money, that's actually pretty hard. Try our [Patreon front](https://patreon.com/biocosm), which is slightly more likely to actually get your money to us than an envelope full of cash in the post.

If you have cryptocurrency you want to get rid of, send it to these addresses:

Or if you have access to computers with free electricity, use our coin miner to turn that power into money (slowly):
